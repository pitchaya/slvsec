This repository actually works, but it is unorganized.  Use at your own risk

This is various core for using SLVS-EC protocol with GTH/GTX transciever. Tested with two different Sony cameras and three different Xilinx hardware ( Artix 7, Kintex 7, Artix Ultrascale+ ) 

The core does not include any thing related to transciever core. You are on your own.
